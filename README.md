# hello-world
My first repository!
<br> 
With this portfolio, I hope to exceed my own personal goals when it comes to learning code alone. I work full time as an espresso repair technician and am looking to change fields. I love Thai food, and Persian food. Well, only my mom's persian food. 
Thanks for reading!
